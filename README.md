# one_button_ai

„One Button AI“ is a minimalistic yet thought-provoking creation that invites users to engage in a unique interactive experience. The piece consists of a single arcade button and a radial RGB LED ring. The concept is simple: by pressing the button, the user trains a very basic AI system. The frequency and amount of the button pressing behavior is used as training data for a simple artificial neural network.

The AI system’s training process can be visualized on a secondary screen, where the user can observe how the network adapts and evolves with each button press. The RGB LED ring also provides direct visual feedback by emitting neuronal patterns that pinpoint the AI’s behaviourla state.

The design is intentionally minimalistic to emphasize the simplicity and accessibility of the concept. Through this piece, the mediation of what an AI is and it’s working principle becomes approachable. It provokes a playful exploration of the possibilities and limitations of AI, encouraging a deeper understanding and appreciation of this evolving technology.
